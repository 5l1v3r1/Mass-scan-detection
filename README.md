# Mass-scan-detection v0.0.1
Concept for a scan detection script to find NSE vulnerability scans and end the connection to create false-positives and negatives.

Only works on Slowloris sofar

**Server >> Find the scan**

**Connecter >> Warned from here**

## What does it do
**NSE scripts send data that is being picked up to find the scan.**
